# Green Purchase Behavior of Millennials in India
#### [ MR project (academic) using Excel, SPSS etc. ]

The term “green products” is defined as “products that will not pollute the earth or deplore natural resources, and [that] can be recycled or conserved. To promote Green Products, marketers must focus on consumer preferences and decision-making processes. India is the fastest-growing major economy, with a growth rate of 7.6 % in 2015-2016, and the second-largest population base (1.32 Bn), resulting in rapid industrialization and hence environment degradation. India is one of the most polluted countries, with around 30 Indian cities figuring in the top 100 most-polluted global cities across the world, as per May 2016 data published by World Health Organization (WHO), pollution kills 1.2 million people in India every year and India faces three % of GDP decline every year due to pollution (Times of India)

Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is selected as the main theoretical framework in this research alongside some other variables (environmental concern, environmental knowledge, and willingness to pay), which are added in the research model to expand TPB application.

This study explores the relationships between environmental attitude, green product knowledge, attitude towards purchasing green products, green product purchasing intention, and green purchasing behavior Using a cross-sectional online survey approach.

Understanding green purchase behavior (GPB) and consumers’ attitude toward environmentally friendly products can be useful for corporations exploring insights on sustainable marketing models for the business market. 

To facilitate sustainable movement, green consumption, and conservation, behavioral factors are being explored in emerging economies.

## Problem Statement
  The research presented here addresses the reasons behind the environment-friendly consumption by the millennials. In other words, this research seeks to study the green purchasing decisions of millennials.
  
## Research Objectives
The mission of the research is to address the following issues -

     A) What are the reasons that influence millennials to buy green products? 

     B) Consumers’ sensitivity (attitude, perception) towards the green purchase.
Sampling and Statistical Method
Sampling- We approached several respondents with specific survey questions
that we hoped would generate appropriate research data for our research objective.
For that, we created a (convenient) online survey form with the help of google form
and collected responses through the same.
Statistical approachStratum - Demographic Parameters.
[Note: each stratum themselves must be homogeneous]
  1. Age range (Millennials)
  2. Gender
  3. Location (respondents’ input)
  4. Education
  5. Profession
  6. City Tiers
  7. Income range

Can be used especially. For income /age subset – if mutually exclusive (esp.
M/F/Others),


Additionally, can be proportionate/disproportionate (based on analytical
consideration- variability of the respondents).
#####  [Note: proportionate – specific criteria (location (state/city tiers), No. of individual samples (x% samples in Y population, no. =(Y/x%) Age, income – predefined range (undergraduate/graduate, male, and female are defined, groups) % Or the ratio of sample strata among strata population]


## Clustering
  (Note: each cluster is designed to be heterogeneous (C1 =Age and(M/F/Others), C2= (M/F/Others), and Income C3= Age+ Income… etc.)
   u C1 ≠ C2
    C1 Male ● Education
    C2 Female ● City
    C1 / C3≠C4
    C3 Others ● Occupation
    C4 Female ● Age● C1 / C2 / C4 ≠ C5
    C5 Others ● Income Range
Additionally, Reliability, validity tests, Chi-square, Annova, Cross Tabulations,
Correlation, Multilinear regression, T-test, Normality, Parametric and non-Parametric
test were done to satisfy the necessary conditions (i.e., hypothesis testing, normal
distribution, significance level, correlation type, etc.)


## Sample Size - 

Because the survey questionnaire focuses on categorical data (such as
frequency of buying behavior of and know about cloud kitchen., we found the sample
size using the Percentage Confidence Interval Formula for Sample Size. The equation
is shown below:

n = z^2 * (p*q) / e^2
n = Sample size
p = estimated percentage in the population
q = 100-p
e = acceptable error (sought accuracy level)


The convenience sample we used for our research was rich with relevant individuals, so we set p at the value of 85%. Z was set to the standard 95% confidence
level, 1.96, at 90%, it’s 1.645. Similarly, we set the desired accuracy level to the oftenused value of 6%

n = (1.645) ^2 * (85*15) / (5) ^2 =138 || n = (1.96) ^2 * (90*10) / (5) ^2 = 138
responses

Despite our best efforts, we could not get 138 respondents, instead of achieving a total of 82. This reduced number of respondents resulted in a slightly higher error rate.
Calculating for the actual error rate:

e = (1.96) *SQRT [p*q / n]
= (1.96) * SQRT [90 * 10/ 82] or,
= 6.49
e= (1.645) *SQRT [90*10/82] = 6.49

The resulting actual error of 6.49% was believed to be close enough to the desired
value of 5%, hence we can move forward with the research.

## Hypothesis:
  H01: Influences significantly factor into purchasing green productsHa1: Influences does not factor into purchasing green products
  
  H02: confirmation of purchase influences sensitivity
  
  Ha2: confirmation of purchase does not influence sensitivity towards the green products
  
  
  ## Analysis/Research Findings
   ### Survey Analyses:
    Findings - there are 82 valid sample values with 84 variables – resulting in 6888 datasets
The Tests of Normality table contains two different hypothesis tests of normality: Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk.


 Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) is a nonparametric test. It technically can be used to test if the data come from a known, specific distribution (not just the normal distribution). Its null hypothesis is that the data come from the specified distribution; the alternative hypothesis is that the data do not come from the specified distribution.
 Shapiro-Wilk is a parametric test. Its null hypothesis is that the sample was drawn from a normal distribution; its alternative hypothesis is that
the sample was not drawn from a normal distribution. (The criteria used to reject or not reject the null hypothesis is the same for both
tests)

Since the p-value (0.05) is greater than the significance level αlpha (0.000), hence, we do not reject the null hypothesis. p-value implies but does not prove, that the data is not normally distributed.

(separate p-values for the K-S test versus the Shapiro-Wilk test; they do NOT share the same p-value. These two tests can disagree; that is, one
test may indicate non-normality, but the other may not.) From the Descriptive table, Skewness value for negative influence = -1.985, for
positive influence = -0.608; since for confidence level 95%, z value =+/- 1.96, it’s not normally distributed. In the associated QQ plot (Expected Normal vs
observed Value), 2-3 values are close to the line – it implies that data approximately normally distributed.


### The Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot shows the same information as the Normal
Q-Q Plot, but differently. In the Detrended Plot, the horizontal line at the origin
represents the quantiles that we would expect to see if the data were normal;
the dots represent the magnitude and direction of deviation in the observed
quantiles. Each dot is calculated by subtracting the expected quantile from the
observed quantile. (This implies that if a dot is below the trend line on the
Normal Q-Q plot, it will appear above the trend line on the Detrended
Normal Q-Q plot, because observed - expected > 0.)


Boxplot – for negative influence, outliers beyond lower whisker (quartile
group 1), suggests values are not normally distributed.Positive influence, QQ plot 4 values are closely aligned, similarly in the
Detrended Normal Q-Q Plot, as well.


Boxplot suggests – Positive influence high level of influence on
purchasing(short Q1, Q3, and median as well as lower whisker).
Cluster – There’s a 102% jump from stage 2 to stage 3, hence can be concluded
that there’re 2 major clusters (between Gender and education).
For Attitude, Pearson Chi-Square =273.553 for the degree of freedom 394
(goodness of fit) (against dependent variable Perception)


The likelihood ratio of chi-square (between perception as dependent variable
and Attitude)

Again Wald chi-square is 34.674 for df =1, perception has a significant relation
with attitude, whereas with COP it’s non-significant.
Following, the B values represent the coefficient Of the dependent variable
(Y=B0 +B1X1+B2X2+B3X3+……… epsilon (error) )

T-test- Paired Samples Correlations (Pairs are negatively correlated for pair
1,2,3,5,7, rest is positively correlated and approximately significant)
F score =1.076, where sig value (0.374) which suggest there’s a difference of
37.4% between no of the population on purchase frequency.
In Post Hoc, esp. in Scheffe crosstab test dependent – purchase frequency and
annual income)

Model fit, chii sq. value =83.037 with df =7, since its sig value is < 0.05, hence
implies as significant and fit. Since the sample is not normally distributed, hence
chi sq. goodness fit comes off as non-significant. Nagelkerke R^2 =96.3%
which is a higher correlative value.

The parallel lines test suggests - The null hypothesis about the location
parameters (slope coefficients) are the same across response categories.
Again in correlations table, Pearson correlation amongst Confirmation of purchase and influence behind purchasing or rejecting are of mixed responses
(some values are -ve but significant, +ve and significant, -ve and nonsignificant), added to that negative influence and confirmation of purchase is
highly correlated than positive influence (R =93.3% R^2=87.1%) from such
observations, it implies that negative influences affect more than positive
influences.

From the given normal distributed histogram, it implies that the dependent
variable is not entirely normally distributed.In the non-parametric test, from Kendall tau, and Spearman, the relation
between positive influence and traits = +ve, significant, whereas the relation
between negative influence and traits = -ve, and significant.
Coming to reliability and validity, stated earlier –

Perception -Cronbach alpha =.97 (>0.7), hence a perfectly reliable, and a valid
sample of perception values. There’s a high inter-correlation between
perception values (around 80%-95%).

Attitude -Cronbach alpha =.98 (>0.7), hence a perfectly reliable, and valid
sample of Attitudevalues. There’s a high inter-correlation between perception
values (around 85%-99%).

( COP = Confirmation of purchase -yes/no etc.)

## Conclusion:
We’re concluding that the Influencing factors significantly influence purchasing
of green products, but there’s no conclusive data that strongly recommends, that
sensitivity – perception and associated attitude, influenced by COP (confirmation of
purchase). Further study is required in this area to clarify the link.
This research intends to reveal the factors that influence the purchase behavior of
green products among Millenials in the context of the developing country's
environment(esp. India). involving the essence of TPB, VBN, ABC, etc. the result of
this research provides more understanding about the factors influencing the purchase
intention toward green products among Indonesian young consumers. The analysis of
three hundred twenty-six empirical data proves that three out of eight hypotheses were
not supported. The young consumers’ perception toward green products is
positively/negatively influenced by the given factors (societal, etc.) and their
willingness to purchase, or even frequency of purchase (in the case of willing
individuals), their subjective norm, while the attitude and environmental concern do
not influence the purchase intention toward environmentally-friendly products. The
findings require to discuss further.

## Recommendations:
 Choosing the respondents is a more crucial task, to avoid unsatisfactory
analyses. As well as, a sufficient number of respondents is necessary.
 More theoretical frameworks are necessary.
 Further study on this area is recommended.
 FMCG, and the conglomerates, as well as the Swadeshi store, should move in
the direction of creating and marketing green products (from household
appliances to daily necessity items).
